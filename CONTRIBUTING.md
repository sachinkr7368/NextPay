4. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types and interfaces
- Avoid `any` type
- Use meaningful variable names

### React/Next.js

- Use functional components
- Use hooks for state management
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks

### NestJS

- Follow NestJS best practices
- Use dependency injection
- Create DTOs for validation
- Use guards for authorization

### General

- Follow ESLint rules
- Use Prettier for formatting
- Write self-documenting code
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

## Testing Guidelines

### Frontend Tests

```typescript
// Component test example
describe('PricingCard', () => {
  it('renders with correct props', () => {
    render(<PricingCard {...props} />)
    expect(screen.getByText('Pro')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```

### Backend Tests

```typescript
// E2E test example
describe("Auth (e2e)", () => {
  it("should register a new user", () => {
    return request(app.getHttpServer())
      .post("/api/auth/register")
      .send(userData)
      .expect(201);
  });
});
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md for major changes
