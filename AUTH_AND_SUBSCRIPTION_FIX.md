# Authentication & Subscription Display Fix

## 🔍 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Logged-in Users Can Access Auth Pages

**Problem**: Users who were already logged in could still visit `/auth/signin` and `/auth/signup` pages.

**Solution**: Added automatic redirect logic to auth pages. Now when logged-in users try to visit these pages, they're automatically redirected to the dashboard.

### 2. ✅ Profile Not Showing Subscription Plan

**Problem**: After purchasing a subscription through Stripe, the profile page didn't show the current plan - it always showed "Free".

**Solution**:

- Added subscription plan display to profile page
- Added "Refresh" button to manually sync plan from Stripe
- Shows current plan with crown icon and premium badge
- Displays plan-specific descriptions

## 🔧 How to Fix "Free Plan" Issue

If you purchased a subscription but still see "Free Plan":

### Option 1: Use Refresh Button (Easiest)

1. Go to your **Profile** page (`/dashboard/profile`)
2. Look for the "Current Plan" card at the top
3. Click the **"Refresh"** button (🔄 icon)
4. Your plan will sync from Stripe and update automatically

### Option 2: Use Billing Page

1. Go to **Billing** page (`/dashboard/billing`)
2. Click the **"Refresh Status"** button
3. Your plan will sync from Stripe

### Option 3: Log Out and Log In

1. Log out from your account
2. Log back in
3. Your plan should refresh automatically

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Free Plan" Still Shows After Refresh

**Possible Causes**:

1. **Webhook not fired** - Stripe webhook might not have triggered
2. **Price ID mismatch** - Backend price IDs don't match Stripe
3. **Subscription not active** - Payment might still be processing

**Debug Steps**:

#### Step 1: Check Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
2. Navigate to **Customers** → Find your email
3. Check if subscription is **Active**
4. Note the **Price ID** of your subscription

#### Step 2: Verify Backend Configuration

1. Check Railway backend logs for webhook events
2. Look for lines like:
   ```
   Webhook - Price comparison: {
     receivedPriceId: 'price_xxx',
     proPriceId: 'price_yyy',
     enterprisePriceId: 'price_zzz'
   }
   ```
3. Ensure the price IDs match

#### Step 3: Check Environment Variables

Make sure backend has correct price IDs:

```bash
STRIPE_PRICE_PRO=price_1SI58JLV9XDn5rbH7mHIsqWj
STRIPE_PRICE_ENTERPRISE=price_1SI5BRLV9XDn5rbH3yQsOsLs
```

#### Step 4: Manual Sync via API

Use the debug endpoint to check configuration:

```bash
GET https://your-api.railway.app/api/payments/debug/config
```

This will show:

- Which environment variables are set
- If price IDs exist in Stripe
- Price details and status

#### Step 5: Check Webhook Configuration

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → **Developers** → **Webhooks**
2. Find your webhook URL: `https://your-api.railway.app/api/payments/webhook`
3. Click to view recent webhook events
4. Look for `checkout.session.completed` event
5. Check if it succeeded or failed

### Auth Pages Still Accessible When Logged In

**Problem**: Sometimes browser caching can cause delays in redirect.

**Solution**:

1. Hard refresh the page (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try in incognito/private mode

### Profile Shows Wrong Plan

**Problem**: Plan shows one tier but you purchased another.

**Solution**:

1. Click "Refresh" button on profile
2. Check Stripe dashboard for your actual subscription
3. Contact support if mismatch persists

   - Status: **Enabled**

3. **Test Webhook**:

   ```

4. **Check Logs**: Monitor Railway logs during test purchase

### Post-deployment Testing

1. Create a test account

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Auth Flow

```
User visits /auth/signin
  ↓
Check localStorage for token
  ↓
Token exists? → Redirect to /dashboard
Token missing? → Show sign-in form
```

### Plan Display Flow

```
User visits /dashboard/profile
  ↓
Fetch user data from /users/me
  ↓
Fetch subscription from /payments/subscription
  ↓
Display plan with status
  ↓
User clicks "Refresh"
  ↓
Call /payments/sync-subscription
  ↓
Get latest data from Stripe
  ↓
Update database and UI
```

### Subscription Sync Flow

```
User completes Stripe checkout
  ↓
Stripe sends webhook to /api/payments/webhook
  ↓
Backend extracts subscription data
  ↓
Matches price ID to plan tier
  ↓
Updates user.plan in database
  ↓
User sees updated plan on next page load

If webhook fails:
  ↓
User clicks "Refresh" button
  ↓
Manual sync fetches from Stripe API
  ↓
Updates plan and shows success message
```

## 📝 API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/users/me` - Get current user profile + plan
- `PATCH /api/users/me` - Update profile info
- `GET /api/payments/subscription` - Get subscription details
- `POST /api/payments/sync-subscription` - Manually sync from Stripe
- `GET /api/payments/debug/config` - Debug Stripe configuration

## 🎉 Summary

Your app now has:

- ✅ Automatic redirect for logged-in users on auth pages
- ✅ Beautiful plan display on profile page
- ✅ Manual "Refresh" button to sync plan from Stripe
- ✅ Visual indicators (crown icon, premium badge)
- ✅ Plan-specific descriptions and CTAs
- ✅ Real-time sync with loading states
- ✅ Toast notifications for sync status
- ✅ Automatic plan detection from user data
- ✅ Fallback sync if webhook fails

## 💡 Tips

1. **Always use "Refresh" after purchase**: If plan doesn't update automatically, click the Refresh button
2. **Check Stripe Dashboard**: Verify subscription is active before troubleshooting
3. **Monitor Webhook Logs**: Railway logs show webhook events and price comparisons
4. **Test with Test Cards**: Use `4242 4242 4242 4242` for testing
5. **Wait for Processing**: Sometimes webhooks take 10-30 seconds to fire

All fixes are complete and ready to deploy! 🚀
