# Stripe Webhook 500 Error Fix

## 🔍 The Problem

Your Stripe webhooks were failing with **500 Internal Server Error** because:

1. **Raw Body Parsing Missing** - Stripe webhooks need raw body to verify signatures
2. **Poor Error Handling** - Webhook errors weren't logged properly
3. **Missing Edge Cases** - Some webhook scenarios weren't handled

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. **Raw Body Parsing** (`main.ts`)

**Problem**: NestJS was parsing webhook body as JSON, but Stripe needs raw body for signature verification.

**Solution**: Added raw body parsing specifically for webhook endpoint:

```typescript
// Configure raw body parsing for Stripe webhooks
app.use("/api/payments/webhook", express.raw({ type: "application/json" }));
```

### 2. **Better Error Handling** (`payments.service.ts`)

**Problem**: Webhook errors were generic and hard to debug.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling and logging:

```typescript
async handleWebhook(signature: string, payload: Buffer) {
  // Check webhook secret is configured
  if (!webhookSecret) {
    console.error('STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET not configured');
    throw new Error('Webhook secret not configured');
  }

  // Log webhook events
  console.log(`Webhook received: ${event.type}`);

  // Better error handling for each event type
  try {
    // Process webhook...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error processing webhook ${event.type}:`, error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Subscription Change Handler**

**Problem**: `customer.subscription.updated` events weren't properly syncing plans.

**Solution**: Added logic to sync plan when subscription becomes active:

```typescript
private async handleSubscriptionChange(subscription: Stripe.Subscription) {
  if (subscription.status === 'active') {
    // Sync plan based on price ID
    const priceId = subscription.items.data[0]?.price?.id;
    let plan = 'free';
    if (priceId === STRIPE_PRICE_PRO) plan = 'pro';
    if (priceId === STRIPE_PRICE_ENTERPRISE) plan = 'enterprise';

    await this.usersService.updateSubscription(userId, plan, customer.id, subscription.id);
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Why This Fixes Your Issue

### Before (500 Error):

```
Stripe sends webhook → Backend tries to verify signature →
Raw body is already parsed as JSON → Signature verification fails →
500 Internal Server Error → Plan never updates
```

### After (Success):

```
Stripe sends webhook → Backend receives raw body →
Signature verification succeeds → Plan updates in database →
User sees correct plan on next page load
```

## 📊 What You'll See Now

### In Stripe Dashboard:

- ✅ **200 OK** instead of 500 ERR
- ✅ Webhook events marked as "Succeeded"
- ✅ No more "Next retry in X minutes"

### In Railway Logs:

```
✅ Webhook received: checkout.session.completed
✅ Webhook - Price comparison: { receivedPriceId: 'price_xxx', ... }
✅ Updating user abc-123 to pro plan
✅ Webhook received: customer.subscription.updated
✅ Processing subscription change for user abc-123: active
✅ Updated user abc-123 to pro plan
```

### In Your App:

- ✅ Plan updates automatically after purchase
- ✅ No need to click "Refresh" button
- ✅ Real-time subscription sync

## 🚀 Deploy the Fix

### 1. Commit and Push Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Stripe webhook 500 errors - add raw body parsing and better error handling"
git push
```

### 2. Monitor Railway Logs

After deployment, watch for successful webhook processing:

```bash
# In Railway dashboard, check logs for:
✅ Webhook received: checkout.session.completed
✅ Updating user [userId] to [plan] plan
```

### 3. Test Webhook

Make a test purchase and watch the logs to ensure webhooks succeed.

## 🔧 Environment Variables Check

Make sure these are set correctly in Railway:

```bash
# Required for webhook signature verification
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret

# Required for plan matching
STRIPE_PRICE_PRO=price_1SI58JLV9XDn5rbH7mHIsqWj
STRIPE_PRICE_ENTERPRISE=price_1SI5BRLV9XDn5rbH3yQsOsLs

# Required for Stripe API
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_secret_key
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Webhooks Still Fail:

#### 1. Check Webhook Secret

```bash
# In Railway logs, look for:
❌ STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET not configured
```

**Fix**: Set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Railway environment variables.

#### 2. Check Price ID Mismatch

```bash
# In Railway logs, look for:
⚠️ Unknown price ID: price_xxx
```

**Fix**: Update `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO` and `STRIPE_PRICE_ENTERPRISE` to match your actual Stripe price IDs.

#### 3. Check User ID Missing

```bash
# In Railway logs, look for:
❌ No userId in checkout session metadata
```

**Fix**: Ensure checkout session includes `metadata: { userId: user.id }`.

### Debug Webhook Configuration

Use the debug endpoint to check your setup:

```bash
GET https://your-api.railway.app/api/payments/debug/config
```

This will show:

- ✅/❌ Environment variables status
- ✅/❌ Price ID validation
- ✅/❌ Stripe API connectivity

## 📋 Testing Checklist

After deploying the fix:

### 1. Test New Purchase

1. Go to `/pricing`
2. Click "Upgrade" on Pro plan
3. Complete Stripe checkout
4. **Expected**: Plan updates automatically (no refresh needed)

### 2. Check Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks
2. Look for recent `checkout.session.completed` event
3. **Expected**: Status shows ✅ "Succeeded" instead of ❌ "Failed"

### 3. Check Railway Logs

1. Go to Railway dashboard → Logs
2. Look for webhook processing messages
3. **Expected**: See success messages like "Updating user to pro plan"

### 4. Verify Database

Your user record should now have:

```sql
SELECT plan, stripeCustomerId, stripeSubscriptionId
FROM users
WHERE email = 'your@email.com';

-- Should show:
-- plan: 'pro' (or 'enterprise')
-- stripeCustomerId: 'cus_xxx'
-- stripeSubscriptionId: 'sub_xxx'
```
